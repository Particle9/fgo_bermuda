    kirschtaria "Ophelia-"
    ophelia "Yes, Lord Kirschtaria."
    kirschtaria "Before you return to your Lostbelt- can I have some moment of your time?"
    kirschtaria "There's something I need to show you."
    ophelia "Yes, of course."



    kirschtaria "Do you see that tree-"

    kirschtaria "Now did you see it-"
    ophelia "Yeah- it was- gigantic. "
    ophelia "Is that, a Fantasy Tree? Daybit's Lostbelt?"
    kirschtaria "No, it is not-"
    kirschtaria "His Lostbelt was- different, it didn't need fantasy tree to survive."
    kirschtaria "And this tree was way bigger than any other Lostbelt."
    kirschtaria "Even the fully grown tree here in Olympus are nowhere near that height-"

    ophelia "Are you suggesting it's the Alien God secret?"
    kirschtaria "It could very well be- but if it is what was her motive on hiding it?"

    kirschtaria "I'm thinking of sending Caenis to investigate- however-"
    ophelia "However?"

    # Koyanskaya
    kirschtaria "That's what that fox said-"
    kirschtaria "While I don't think we can fully believe Koyanskaya- I don't think she have any reason to lie in this matter-"
    kirschtaria "I'm afraid by interfering, we could awaken some powerful entity inside-"

    ophelia "So- what did you want me to do?"

    kirschtaria "Your mystic eye- it could see past the wall of light could it not?"
    ophelia "Yeah- it does- but after that thing with Surtr-"
    ophelia "I don't think it's wise to use it again."
    kirschtaria "I suppose so-"
    kirschtaria "That is fine, I'll think of some other way-"
