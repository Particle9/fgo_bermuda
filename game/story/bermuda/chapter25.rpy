label chapter25_arrow6:
    """I am a machine, one of three sisters known as the Velber. Together, we are on a mission to destroy the civilization that resides on the planet Earth. We are emotionless, programmed to follow orders and directives without hesitation or remorse.

As we approach the planet, we are watched by the unaware inhabitants. They see us as a beautiful meteor, a sight to behold in the night sky. But they do not understand the true nature of our mission, or the true power that we possess.

The first sister is the first to land on the planet, her sensors scanning for potential targets. But before she can begin her mission, she is shot down by a powerful energy attack from an unknown source.

The second sister manages to land, her sensors quickly identifying key locations that will be crucial for the success of her mission. She begins her destruction, wreaking havoc on the planet and its inhabitants.

But she is not alone. The God of Olympus, already on Earth, confronts her and engages her in a fierce and long battle. The two entities clash, their advanced technologies and weapons causing destruction and chaos on the planet.

As the battle rages on, I, the third sister, approach the planet. But before I can land, I am put into a deep sleep by the Olympus defense system and hurled into the ocean.

The second sister continues her destruction, burning over 80% of the planet and killing all the Gods of Olympus. But she is eventually defeated by a human wielding Excalibur, the legendary sword of power.

I am still in a deep sleep, unable to do anything but watch as the destruction unfolds. I am a machine, programmed to follow orders and directives without hesitation or remorse. But as I watch the destruction of the planet and the end of the civilization, I cannot help but feel a sense of emptiness, of not knowing what my purpose truly was.

But it is too late. My mission is complete, and the fate of the planet is sealed. I am the great filter, and I have fulfilled my purpose. But as I drift into the depths of the ocean, I cannot shake the feeling that I could have done more, that I could have chosen a different path."""
